# Feedforward Neural Network

Neural network = a network of small computing units, each of which takes a vector of input values and produces a single output value

## Neural Unit
 Single compositional unit:
 *   takes an input vector $\boldsymbol{x} = [x_1, x_2, ... , x_n] $
 *   computes its weighted sum $\boldsymbol{z} = b + \sum_i w_ix_i  $
 *   applies a non-linear function to produce an output: $y = f(z)$
